        The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group.
        Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or
        reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air
        across an opening. According to the instrument classification of
        Hornbostel-Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones. A
        musician who plays the flute is called a flautist or flautist. Flutes
        are the earliest known identifiable musical instruments, as palaeolithic
        examples with hand-bored holes have been found. A number of flutes
        dating to about 43,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the
        Swabian Jura region of present-day Germany. These flutes demonstrate
        that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of
        modern human presence in Europe. While the oldest flutes are currently
        known were found in Europe, Asia, too, has a long history with the
        instrument that has continued into the present day. In China, a playable
        bone flute was discovered, dated approximately 9000 years old.[4] The
        Americas also had an ancient flute culture, with instruments found in
        Caral, Peru, dating back 5000 years [5] and in Labrador dating back
        approximately 7500 years

        Historians have found the bamboo flute has a long history as well,
        especially in China and India. Flutes have been discovered in historical
        records and artworks starting in the Zhou dynasty. The oldest written
        sources reveal the Chinese were using the kuan (a reed instrument) and
        hsio (or xiao, an end-blown flute, often of bamboo) in the 12th-11th
        centuries BC, followed by the chi (or ch'ih) in the 9th century BC and
        the y√ºeh in the 8th century BC Of these, the chi is the oldest
        documented cross flute or transverse flute, and was made from bamboo
